Project 2: The Landing Project

For this project, I decided to make a website about cats and cat lovers, simply called "Cat Lovers".
This webpage introduces the general content of the website to the users.

Cat Lovers is basically a community created for Cat Lovers to enjoy cat content.

I have used
* HTML5
* CSS
* FLEXBOX
in the making of this website.

Very happy with how this turned out.
